     <h1>Nostalgia Bait</h1>

<P>Kate’s Wagner’s article 404 page not found fascinated me, specifically the nostalgia of the old web. I believe in current day, nostalgia has enveloped in our everyday culture trying to cling to the past masking it through glimmer instead of purpose, fueling the feel-good times without any understanding why it felt good to begin with. One quote from the article that solidified my opinion on this, “Nostalgia, I’m reminded, is profitable—it remains one of the easiest to execute and cheapest grifts of neoliberal culture.” It is no wonder why nostalgia feels cheap because it is, it appeals to a culture that’s  long gone, existing off of feel-good imagery, references etc. because it’s cheaper way to produce something already existing than it is to make something new. This is no different from websites, websites today feel sterile just minimalizing everything for the sake of aesthetic just like Nostalgia does, “For with the collapse of the high-modernist ideology of style-what is as unique and unmistakable as your own fingerprints, as incomparable as your own body [e.g. MySpace, Geocities pages]…the producers of culture [big internet companies] have nowhere to turn but to the past: the imitation of dead styles [glitter graphics, Geocities]”.</P>

<P>Apps like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram etc. shows us this collapse of modernist ideology  how minimalism brings in traction, monetization, attention and because of this enforce these principles for other websites and apps to complete with, losing uniqueness of identity which enforces everyone else to do the same repeating the cycle. One subject related to Nostalgia is vaporware, which was an aesthetic movement in the 2010’s studying the futility of the contemporary capitalism, often going into utopian beliefs than dystopia, “What if the utopian innocence of those early Geocities websites had survived, and what if we all lived in chill, pastel, communal harmony? What makes vaporwave so distinct, other than its dubiously Marxist undertones, is that it is utopian and therefore against the grain of the modern mania for dystopian thought.” I personally like this, its nostalgia for the opposite reason, it’s trying to preserve these old websites without diminishing it just for-profit gain trying to fight back against the established hierarchy that was growing in 2010’s social media. </P>

<P> Unfortunately, Vaporware’s aesthetic style was taken over by social media twisting its ideology to be fixated to Nostalgia devoid of identity, “The critique offered by vaporwave—its defiant sense of utopia—was immediately and effectively erased, leaving only a commodified, nostalgic aesthetic. And this aesthetic detritus, its millennial pink, Memphis-esque shapes and squiggles made entirely for Instagram, became cold, devoid of joy and playfulness.” Nostalgia has become nothing more than aesthetic for the sake of aesthetic, becoming a hollow profitable approach to design, appealing to everyone without any true thought, value, or purpose to the design which then bleeds into our own reality, “I barely need to mention the dark side of the platform, the side that leaves people lining up for hours just to get a selfie, that has changed how we design products, furniture, even buildings and neighborhoods—all of this is well-documented. What is not so obvious is the way Instagram recycles the original aesthetics, indeed the political ethos, that arose from vaporwave and even the early internet itself, into a decontextualized set of images: the internet has become nostalgia in search of a platform.”</P>

<P> This is why I’m concerned about the future of websites; websites are starting to revolve around this need for attention and glamor instead of purpose, style and art. I believe one day this will backfire it may not happen now but slowly people will realize Nostalgia doesn’t add anything meaningful to our current society, only reflecting past ideas that need to stay in the past.
